## Report 1 Readme

Report 1 analyzes ridership statistics from 2017-2022 at a yearly/monthly scale. It was written in R/tidyverse using Jupyter Lab as an interface for both coding and publishing.

A readable Markdown version of the final report is available (report_1_nb.md), and will be published as a LinkedIn blog post. The underlying code that produced the report is available as a static Jupyter Notebook (report_1_nb.ipynb).

The pipeline to generate the data used in Report 1 is available in Data Processing.

To come: Some thoughts on the pros and cons of Jupyter as an interface for producing convenient, readable reports for a non-technical audience.
